# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/rc1yymqev9r7n5knkrxhxq)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

## Add the provided logo / header image

Place the image you attached to me into the project's `public/` folder using these filenames:

- `public/logo.png` — used by the header and footer as the brand logo
- `public/header.jpg` — used as the hero/header background image

If you only want one file, you can copy the same image to both names. Restart the dev server after adding the files.

If you want the logo to render crisply on retina screens, provide a higher-resolution image (2x or 3x) and add naming like `logo@2x.png` and update the references accordingly.
